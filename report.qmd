## Introduction

*How to restore an urban stream in a manner that contributes to urban climate adaptation, aids biodiversity, and at the same time improves quality of life of citizens?*

This report presents a spatial Multi Criteria Data Analysis and Typology Construction to determine possibilities for the Teplica river in the town Senica (Slovakia).

Note: This is student work created as part of the Applied Spatial Analysis for Sustainable Urban Development course at TU Delft.

##### Key words:

Urban Stream Restoration, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX

## Methods

<!--# add intro!!! -->

### MCDA

::: callout
Multi Criteria Decision Analysis is a research style that advises decision making based on evaluation of multiple objectives and criteria. It aims to formalize problems and evaluate them by mathematical means. <!-- Do we need a source? -->
:::

#### Selection of objectives and criteria – three pillar system

<!--Add diagrams and text describing the approach to create objectives, research questions and subquestions -->

![Research structure – flow chart of topics - objectives - attributes, highlighted the ones we chose - placeholder](/img/placeholder.png)

#### Data layers

##### Data structure

<!--Talk about how we deal with data, sources, what geometries we use for what and how overview of approaches to agregate data from original geometry types to the analysis geometry -->
