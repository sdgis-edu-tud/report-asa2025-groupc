Multi Criteria Decision Analysis is a research style that advises decision making based on evaluation of multiple objectives and criteria. It aims to formalize problems and evaluate them by mathematical means. <!-- Do we need a source? -->
:::

### Selection of objectives and criteria – three pillar system

<!--Add diagrams and text describing the approach to create objectives, research questions and subquestions -->

#### Detailed research structure

![Research structure – detailed flow chart, version 27. 5. (open image in new tab to see in full).](img/ResearchStructure_20250527.jpg)

### Analysis geometry

The analysis geometry is a vector polygon layer consisting of morphologically determined elements. The decision to create geometry tailored to the local spatial conditions has two main reasons:

1.  to make the analysis more accessible to locals – through analysing on geometry familiar to them, hopefully making interpretation easier, and
2.  to make the results more actionable – through analysing on logical spatial units results will be more space-specific

At the core is a *Regional biocorridor* as indicated in *Spatial Ecological Stability System* (*ÚSES*) – an approximately 20 meter buffer around the stream. We differentiate left and right bank, because it matters for accessibility (significant for all attributes in quality of life).

The bounds of the analysis geometry were determined based on the floodplain of the river indicated by flood danger maps. This is the area that "belongs" to the river, thus it should be restored together with the watercourse. (The outline was based on raster data available online and spatial logic of the area to respect natural boundaries.)

The flood plain was partitioned based on local morphology and land cover, and in some cases inspired by the parcellation structure to create a smaller grain in areas with large unpartitioned fields.

#### Analysis geometry update after 27. 5. consultation

Cells along the river: i went through it manually and merged some cells to create larger areas. Always merged only the ones that i previously classified as the same landcover. I did it based on spatial logic and continuity of surrounding division lines. Left and right bank is still distinguished.

Other cells: In few places, i simplified field separation and merged a road into it (where there is no significant different type of land cover along the road.)

#### Land cover classification

The analysis geometry was manually assigned Land Cover classes. Below is an overview of these classes with a typical example. Each land cover class was assigned an estimate ecological quality indicator based on intuition.

### Biodiversity

<!--# intro -->

***How to improve local and supra local biodiversity resilience by interventions within the stream flood plain? -\> which spaces to prioritize based on value and feasibility of intervention***

WIP – please refer to the main research structure flow chart for overview.

#### #1 Which spaces should be prioritised because of their connectivity to ÚSES?

polygons in which ÚSES elements are present --\> 1

polygons that are connected by (contuinuos) "green" land cover to ÚSES elements --\> 0,3

other polygons --\> 0

#### #2 Which spaces should be prioritised based on ecological quality improvement potential?

Our argument is that spaces with a potential for a high impact improvement and at the same time good investment feasibility should be prioritised, because of good actionability of intentions/plans.

Potential for high impact improvement is determined by unsatisfactory ecological quality. Investment feasibility is determined by attractivity to invest in biodiversity improvement and in general spatial quality improvement in an area like this. High investment feasibility is in the surrounding of dwellings, in spaces that are already upkept. Low investment feasibility is in agricultural areas, where produce is prioritised. In these areas in general it is advised to use agricultural methods that can aid local biodiversity.

![Ecological quality improvement potential in bottom row.](/img/B_LandCover_ImprovementPotential.png)

#### #3 Which spaces should be prioritized based on the state of the vegetation?

Based on the different value of NDVI mean, we can deduce the vegetation state in each spatial geometry.

-   **\< 0** – Water bodies, shadows, or noise

-   **0–0.1** – Bare soil or urban hardscape

-   **0.1–0.3** – Sparse or dry vegetation

-   **0.3–0.6** – Moderate vegetation

-   **\> 0.6** – Dense and healthy vegetation

#### Weighting

#### Biodiversity conclusion

### Climate adaptation

***how to use areas in the flood plain to capture water in the landscape? -\> where is good space for infiltration basins and natural flood protection measures based on soil types and flood risk?***

<!--# intro -->

<!-- The question needs to be more specific and based in data – what are examples of interventions that can achieve this? How much space do they need? -->

WIP – please refer to the main research structure flow chart for overview.

This chapter is based on the fact that in western slovakia, there is a large drought problem, and water management activities should target capturing water in the landscape. <!-- ^This needs a source, but it is true. -->

#### #1 Where does the soil have high potential for water retention?

![Soil potential placeholder](/img/CA_soilpotential.png)

#### #2 Where it is likely water will gather?

Flood risk raster, calculated by us. ![Flood risk](/img/CA_FloodRisk.png)

#### #3 Maybe impervious cover ?

We dont know if we will manage to do this, it is now very low priority.

In the case we dont, we think for our goal of capturing water in landscape (as water buffer for flood protection, and also longterm anti-drought measure), the two we already have might be sufficient (while stating general goal overall is to improve surface permeability no matter where.)

![LST draft](/img/LST_analysis_prediction_draft02.png)

THIS IS A DRAFT: To analyse surface temperatures, we found a [Google Earth Engine script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/ac986028b56a794aefd3ea54e9cb09ba) that uses information from Sentinel-2, LANDSAT, and DEM to predict a raster LST (land surface temperature) with a higher resolution, namely 10-meter resolution. The computations are complicated, but the results are nice. The draft image shows the results for dates 2024-06-01 to 2024-08-31, since these three months include the summer and will therefore be most susceptible for heat stress, which makes this time period interesting to look at for our research.

General steps (DRAFT): 

* Use GEE code (reference properly) 
* Download GeoTiff 
* Use QGIS to convert GeoTiff raster to vector, save as GeoPackage 
* Values from raster, become new layer "DN"
* Use field calculator: (maximum("DN") - "DN") / (maximum("DN") -  minimum("DN")), to create new field normalised 
* The lower the LST, the better and thus the higher norm value (closer to 1 for lower LST)

### Quality of life

<!--# intro -->

***what type of places should be created in the stream flood plain?*** -\> amenities, green spaces, connections / what combination

WIP – please refer to the main research structure flow chart for overview.

#### #1 potential for community functions: high angular choice within polygon – local 500 m

#### #2 potential for "central" functions: high angular choice within polygon – walking + larger distance 1000 + 2000 m

#### #3 need for ammenities: lack of ammenities in 500 m reach from polygon

#### #4 need for green: lack of green area in 500 m reach from polygon

#### PLACEHOLDER SPACE SYNTAX – UNTIL WE PUT IT IN CORRECT CHAPTERS

![Angular Choice Analysis (note: idk why it is displayed wrong and don't have time to solve it now, sorry. You can display the frame by itself in new tab to see the pdf nicely.)](pdf/AngularChoice_20250518.pdf){height="100%" width="100%"}

Angular choice:

-   Every choice of path from every location to every destination – how many possible routes go through location

-   500 m

    -   very local scale, scale of children playing and shops on the corner even on this scale, there are some centralities along the river

    -   this means the river has a potential to be used by the community and act as a very local common space under social control

-   1000 m

    -   local scale of walking to shop or walking the dog

    -   paths along river do not have very low angular choice, hinting at them being possibly moderately frequented

    -   more centralities at bridges

-   2000m:

    -   close to the end of walkable scale

    -   some paths along river in the center have high angular choice, meaning they will likely be more frequented and have potential for active use and ammenities

    -   more centralities at bridges

Attraction Reach Green space

-   What is the **reachable** potential **attraction density** of location (sqm)

    green areas weighted by area

-   500m:

    -   very local scale, scale of children playing and shops on the corner

    -   river and surroundings as potential new green areas to serve local scale in the west and north of the town

-   1000m:

    -   local scale of walking to shop or walking the dog

    -   river and surroundings as potential new green areas to serve local scale in the west and north of the town

-   2000m:

    -   close to the end of walkable scale

    -   center/east of town not having access to more large areas of green

Attraction Reach Teplica

-   What is the **reachable** potential **attraction density** of location (sqm)

    measured to points every 5m of waterway

-   500m:

    -   very local scale, scale of children playing and shops on the corner

    -   Teplica quite well accessible from houses

    -   SW: industry is not so well connected

    -   SE: lacking connection between road parallel to river

-   1000m:

    -   local scale of walking to shop or walking the dog

    -   SW industry not allowing houses behind it to access river

    -   SE: still visible missing connection between parallel road and river

-   2000m:

    -   close to the end of walkable scale

    -   very similar to 1k

    -   SW: industry finally permeable, however this is quite a large distance and if the river and the way to it are not nice, there are no reasons to go

    -   W: the small village is not connected to a large path of the river, that is why it is lighter

    -   SE: still visible missing connection between parallel road and river

#### Quality of life conclusion

### MCDA conclusion

## Typology construction

We feel like our goal for typology alligns pretty well with our main research question *How to approach stream restoration so that it gives place for desired urban and community facilities, as well as improving biodiversity, ecological connectivity, and water retention in the landscape?*

Hopefully, we will get types of areas that can make it easier to create example design interventions. Perhaps something like "areas with large potential for community facilities with water retention function", "areas with community functions and maintained high biodiversity", "areas with biodiversity boost, improved surface permeability and connectivity".

Plan is I (viola) guess to feed the data in (in various compositions perhaps) and see what happens.
